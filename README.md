//How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?//
  The best method for this is to host a user interview and gather user stories. There is almost no other way to gain a personal
  idea of how a real user wants your website to operate. You can cater to them directly and make the website that much better. 
  
//How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?//
  A program in its entirety should be disected into individual segments that can all be programmed and tested without the need of combining
  them. Once these individual pieces are created and tested they will be combined for a final result. In the Agile sense, these small projects
  wil be segmented into sprints to be worked on by the development team. 
  
//What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?//
  A good team member in software development is an excellent communicator and collaborator. He writes clear comments in his code and follows correct 
  syntax. He writes emails or makes phone calls when answers are needed. He expresses his concerns and gives and takes feedback in a proffesional 
  manner.
